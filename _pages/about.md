Hello! I’m **Giuseppe Farano**.

I am a **Computer Engineer** passionate about bridging the gap between academic research and industrial application. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. within the **National Doctorate in Robotics and Intelligent Machines (ph-DRIM)**.

My academic journey began at **Polytechnic University of Bari**, where I developed a strong foundation in Software Engineering and **Artificial Intelligence**. My Ph.D. research is conducted in partnership with [Leonardo S.p.A.](https://www.leonardo.com/en/) and [CNR STIIMA](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/), where I focus on non-destructive testing and quality control. Specifically, I develop **AI-driven methods to process acoustic and ultrasonic signals**, helping to ensure the safety and reliability of aerospace components.
