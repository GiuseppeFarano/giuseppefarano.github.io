The goal of this project is to classify political blogs as either <b>liberal or conservative</b> using the <b>Polblogs dataset</b>.  
The dataset used is the one recorded and analysed in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1134271.1134277">this paper</a> proposed in 2005, which contains a collection of the political blogs that were most active in 2004 in the run-up to the US presidential election.  
This dataset not only includes metadata about individual blogs but also captures the <b>hyperlinks between</b> them, forming a <b>graph structure</b> that reflects the networked nature of political discourse.

<h2> ðŸ“¬ Key Features </h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Text embedding generation</b>    
    The Polblogs dataset is processed with BERT to obtain text embeddings in order to feed the GCN
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>New architecture proposed</b>  
    A novel architecture is introduced to leverage GCN and adapt them to this dataset

    <b>Metric evaluation on test set</b>  
    After training the model, evaluation metrics were computed on the train set. Here are showed results.
